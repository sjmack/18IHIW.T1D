Materials for The HLA-Associated Type-1-Diabetes in World Populations Data Analysis Session

This repository contains materials for the LA-Associated Type-1-Diabetes in World Populations session at the 2022 IHIW Meeting.

These materials consist of a dataset for data analysis (DRB1.T1D.Azerbaijan.txt) and an R script (18IHIW.R) for use in the session.

To use these files, first make a new folder called "18IHIW" in your Documents folder. Then do the following:

Click the green Code button above, and click 'Download ZIP'.
Unzip the "18IHIW.T1D-main.zip" file in your Downloads folder (either by double-clicking it, or by right-clicking, depending on your system). This will create a new folder called "18IHIW.T1D-main" in your Downloads folder.
Move the DRB1.T1D.Azerbaijan.txt and 18IHIW.R files in the Downloads/18IHIW.T1D-main folder to your Documents/18IHIW folder.
To use these files, Workshop participants should have R, Rstudio, and BIGDAWG installed on their computers.

To install R on your computer, follow the instructions for linux, macOS, or Windows here.

Once R is installed, install Rstudio on your computer using the instructions for your variety of linux, macOS or Windows here.

Once Rstudio has been installed, open Rstudio (by double clicking the icon).

Install BIGDAWG in the Rstudio environment by doing the following:

Go to the Tools pulldown menu, and select "Install Packages ...".
In the popup window, select "Repository (CRAN)" in the "Install from:" menu, and enter "BIGDAWG" in the "Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):" menu.
Click the "Install" button.
Installing BIGDAWG will automatically install all of the other R packages that BIGDAWG requires. This may take a few minutes, and may generate a lot of text in your Rstudio console. This is normal.
